Question #1

Evaluate the following:

a) (5 > 3 && 4 < 8)

true 

b) (4 > 6 && true)

false and
false 

c) (3 >= 3 || false)

true 

d) (true || false) ? 4 : 5

true ? 4:5 
4 

Question #2

Evaluate the following:

a) 7 / 4

1 

b) 14 % 5

4 

Question #3

Why should you never do the following:

a) int y{ foo(++x, x) };

++x leads to a side effect, so we shouldn't use x again in the same expression. there's no specific order for function parameters 

b) double x{ 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 }; return (x == 0.3);

floating point numbers means 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 will lead to some value like 0.30000001. Should use something like the epsilon function 

c) int x{ 3 / 0 };

Dividing by 0 is undefined and crashes
