Question #1

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int smaller{};
    std::cin >> smaller;

    std::cout << "Enter a larger integer: ";
    int larger{};
    std::cin >> larger;

    if (larger < smaller){
        std::cout << "swapping values" << '\n';
        int temp {smaller};
        smaller = larger;
        larger = temp;
    } //temp dies here

    std::cout << "the smaller value is: " << smaller << '\n';
    std::cout << "the larger value is: " << larger << '\n';

    return 0;
} // smaller and larger dies here


Question #2

What’s the difference between a variable’s scope, duration, and lifetime? By default, what kind of scope and duration do local variables have (and what do those mean)?

The scope is the block in which the variable lives. The duration are the rules that determine the variable's life and death. The lifetime is the time between the variable's initialization and death. 

The scope of local variables is within its block. Their duration is automatic, and so they live and die on their block.
