Question #1

Based on how you should name a variable, indicate whether each variable name is conventional (follows best practices), unconventional (compiler will accept but does not follow best practices), or invalid (will not compile), and why.

int sum {};

(Assume it’s obvious what we’re summing)
conventional, function has one word 

int _apples {};
unconventional, underlines used for compilers and OS 

int VALUE {};
unconventional, all capital case 

int my variable name {};
invalid, whitespace

int TotalCustomers {};
unconventional, should start with small letters

int void {};
invalid, void is a keyword 

int numFruit {};
conventional camelcase 

int 3some {};
invalid, starts with an integer 

int meters_of_pipe {};
conventional snakecase
