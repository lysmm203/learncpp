Question #1

What is the difference between a statement and an expression?

An expression is a combination of literals, operators, and function calls that evaluate to a single value, while statement is a way to communicate with the computer to work with data 

Question #2

Indicate whether each of the following lines are statements that do not contain expressions, statements that contain expressions, or are expression statements.

a)

int x;

statement without expression

b)

int x = 5;

statement with expression 

c)

x = 5;

expression statement 

d) Extra credit:

foo(); // foo is a function

expression statement 

e) Extra credit:

std::cout << x; // Hint: operator<< is a binary operator.

expression statement 

Question #3

Determine what values the following program outputs. Do not compile this program. Just work through it line by line in your head.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << 2 + 3 << '\n';

	int x{ 6 };
	int y{ x - 2 };
	std::cout << y << '\n';

	int z{ };
	z = x;
	std::cout << z - x << '\n';

	return 0;
}

outputs the following: 
5
4
0
