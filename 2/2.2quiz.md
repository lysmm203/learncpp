Inspect (do not compile) each of the following programs. Determine what the program will output, or whether the program will generate a compiler error.

Assume you have “treat warnings as errors” turned off.

1a. 16 
1b. Error
1c. Main returns 0 
1d. 5 \n 5 
1e. error, function name has white space
1f. no parenthesis, function not called 

2. Don't Repeat Yourself. By avoiding redundancies in code, it's easier to rewrite and debug it.
