Question #1

In the above program, why is variable inner declared inside the while block instead of immediately following the declaration of outer?

So that with each iteration of the outer block, the inner resets 

Question #2

Write a program that prints out the letters a through z along with their ASCII codes. Use a loop variable of type char.


#include <iostream>

//Write a program that prints out the letters a through z along with their ASCII codes.
//Use a loop variable of type char.


int main()
{
    char curr_char{'a'};

    while (curr_char != 'z'){
        std::cout << "letter: " << curr_char << ' ';
        std::cout << "ASCII value: " << int(curr_char) << '\n';
        ++curr_char;
    }

    return 0;
}


Question #3

Invert the nested loops example so it prints the following:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // outer loops between 1 and 5
    int outer{ 5 };
    while (outer >= 1)
    {
        int inner{ outer };
        while (inner >= 1)
        {
            std::cout << inner << ' ';
            --inner;
        }

        // print a newline at the end of each row
        std::cout << '\n';
        --outer;
    }

    return 0;
}



Question #4

Now make the numbers print like this:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int outer{ 1 };
    while (outer <= 5){
        int inner{5};
        while (inner >= 1)
        {
            if (inner > outer)
            {
                std::cout << ' ';
            }
            else
            {
                std::cout << inner;
            }
            --inner;
        }

        ++outer;
        std::cout << '\n';

    }

    return 0;
}
