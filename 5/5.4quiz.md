Question #1

For each statement, identify:

Whether the variable is non-constant, a runtime constant, or a compile-time constant
Whether the initialization expression is a constant expression or non-constant expression.

char a { 'a' };

constant, non-constant expression 

const double b { 5.0 };

compile-time constant, constant expression 
(apparently this is a runtime expression? what the fuck? how?)

const int c { a * 2 };

runtime constant since a is not compile-time constant. Initialization is constant  

const int d { 0 };

compile-time constant, constant expression 

double e { b + 1.0 };

compile-time constant, non-constant expression
(apparently b is not compile-time constant. I think that's bullshit and a mistake made after editing)

const int f { d + 2 };

compile-time constant, constant expression 

const int g { getNumber() }; // getNumber returns an int by value

getNumber() returns a nonconstant value, so runtime, constant expression

Extra credit:

const int h{};

no initialization expression. h defaults to 0, which is a constant value, constant expression
