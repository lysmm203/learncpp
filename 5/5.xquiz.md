Question #1

Why are named constants often a better choice than literal constants?

Named constants give better context and are easier to change 

Why are const/constexpr variables usually a better choice than #defined symbolic constants?

Because #defined symbolic constants change every instance of the symbol in the code, regardless of scope 


Question #2

Find 3 issues (affecting 4 lines) in the following code.

#include <cstdint> // for std::uint8_t
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "How old are you?\n";

  std::uint8_t age{}; [best not to use uint8_t as they're recognized as characters]
  std::cin >> age;

  std::cout << "Allowed to drive a car in Texas ["; 

  if (age >= 16)        [magic number]
    std::cout << "x";   [should be single quotes]
  else
    std::cout << " ";

  std::cout << "]\n";   

  return 0;
}


Add const and/or constexpr to the following program:

#include <iostream>

// gets height from user and returns it
double getTowerHeight()
{
    std::cout << "Enter the height of the tower in meters: ";
    double towerHeight{};
    std::cin >> towerHeight;
    return towerHeight;
}

// Returns height from ground after "seconds" seconds
constexpr double calculateHeight(double towerHeight, int seconds)
{
    constexpr double gravity{ 9.8 };

    // Using formula: [ s = u * t + (a * t^2) / 2 ], here u(initial velocity) = 0
    const double distanceFallen{ (gravity * (seconds * seconds)) / 2.0 };
    const double currentHeight{ towerHeight - distanceFallen };

    return currentHeight;
}

// Prints height every second till ball has reached the ground
void printHeight(double height, int seconds)
{
    if (height > 0.0)
        std::cout << "At " << seconds << " seconds, the ball is at height: " << height << " meters\n";
    else
        std::cout << "At " << seconds << " seconds, the ball is on the ground.\n";
}

void calculateAndPrintHeight(double towerHeight, int seconds)
{
    const double height{ calculateHeight(towerHeight, seconds) };
    printHeight(height, seconds);
}

int main()
{
    double towerHeight{ getTowerHeight() };

    calculateAndPrintHeight(towerHeight, 0);
    calculateAndPrintHeight(towerHeight, 1);
    calculateAndPrintHeight(towerHeight, 2);
    calculateAndPrintHeight(towerHeight, 3);
    calculateAndPrintHeight(towerHeight, 4);
    calculateAndPrintHeight(towerHeight, 5);

    return 0;
}


Question #4

What are the primary differences between std::string and std::string_view?

std::string creates a copy from the string that it is initialized from. std::string_view only views the passed in string but can't modify anything 

What can go wrong when using a std::string_view?

When the string it is viewing is destroyed, it can lead to uninteded behavior 



Question #5

Write a program that asks for the name and age of two people, then prints which person is older.


#include <iostream>
#include <string>

constexpr int getMax(int x, int y){
    return (x > y ? x : y);
}

std::string getName(){
    std::string name{};
    std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
    std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, name);
    return name;
}

int getAge(){
    int x{};
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";
    std::cin >> x;
    return x;
}

void printOlder(){
    std::string name1{getName()};
    int age1{getAge()};

    std::string name2{getName()};
    int age2{getAge()};

    std::cout << "Older person: ";

    if (getMax(age1, age2) == age1)
        std::cout << name1;
    else
        std::cout << name2;
}

int main (){
    printOlder();
    return 0;
}


Question #6

Complete the following program:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Write the function getQuantityPhrase() here
constexpr std::string getQuantityPhrase(int x){
    std::string res{};
    if (x == 0)
        res = "no";
    else if (x == 1)
        res = "a single";
    else if (x == 2)
        res = "a couple of";
    else if (x == 3)
        res = "a few";
    else
        res = "many";

    return res;
}


// Write the function getApplesPluralized() here

constexpr std::string getApplesPluralized(int x){
    std::string res{ (x == 1 ? "apple" : "apples")};
    return res;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Mary has " << getQuantityPhrase(3) << " " << getApplesPluralized(3) << ".\n";

    std::cout << "How many apples do you have? ";
    int numApples{};
    std::cin >> numApples;

    std::cout << "You have " << getQuantityPhrase(numApples) << " " << getApplesPluralized(numApples) << ".\n";

    return 0;
}
