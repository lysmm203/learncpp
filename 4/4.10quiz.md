Question #1

What is an early return, and what is its behavior?

Early return is a return statement that is not at the end of the function. It can be used in conjunction with conditionals to output different values 

Question #2

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number 0 through 9 (inclusive). If the user enters a number within this range that is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7), print “The digit is prime”. Otherwise, print “The digit is not prime”.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{};
    std::cout << "Enter a prime number less than 10: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x == 2 or x == 3 or x == 5 or x == 7)
        std::cout << "The digit is prime";
    else
        std::cout << "The digit is not prime";

    return 0;
}


Question #3

#include <iostream>

bool isAllowedToTakeFunRide()
{
    std::cout << "How tall are you? (cm)\n";

    double height{};
    std::cin >> height;

    return height >= 140.0;

}

int main()
{
    if (isAllowedToTakeFunRide())
        std::cout << "Have fun!\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Sorry, you're too short.\n";

    return 0;
}
