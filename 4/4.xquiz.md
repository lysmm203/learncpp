Question #1

Pick the appropriate data type for a variable in each of the following situations. Be as specific as possible. If the answer is an integer, pick int (if size isn’t important), or a specific fixed-width integer type (e.g. std::int16_t) based on range.

a) The age of the user (in years) (assume the size of the type isn’t important)

int 

b) Whether the user wants the application to check for updates

boolean

c) pi (3.14159265)

double 

d) The number of pages in a textbook (assume size is not important)

int 

e) The length of a couch in feet, to 2 decimal places (assume size is important)

float 

f) How many times you’ve blinked since you were born (note: answer is in the millions)

std::int32_t

g) A user selecting an option from a menu by letter

char 

h) The year someone was born (assuming size is important)

std::int16_t


Question #2 

int main()
{
    double x{};
    std::cout << "enter a floating point number: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    double y{};
    std::cout << "enter another floating point number: ";
    std::cin >> y;

    char operation{};
    std::cout << "enter the operation you would like to perform: ";
    std::cin >> operation;


    if (operation == '*')
        std::cout << x * y << '\n';
    else if (operation == '+')
        std::cout << x + y << '\n';
    else if (operation == '-')
        std::cout << x - y << '\n';
    else if (operation == '/')
        std::cout << x / y << '\n';

    return 0; 
}


Question #3 

#include <iostream>

double getHeight()
{
    double height{};
    std::cout << "input tower height: ";
    std::cin >> height;
    return height;
}

void calculateHeight(double height)
{
    double gravity_constant {9.8};
    int seconds {0};

    while (seconds <= 5)
    {
        double curr_height {height - (gravity_constant * (seconds * seconds)) / 2.0};

        if (curr_height <= 0)
        {
            std::cout << "the ball hit the ground" << '\n';
            break;
        }

        std::cout << "current height of ball: " << curr_height << '\n';
        seconds += 1;
    }
}


int main()
{

    double height{getHeight()};

    calculateHeight(height);
    return 0;
}
