Quiz time

Question #1

Write a short program where the user is asked to enter a single character. Print the value of the character and its ASCII code, using static_cast.

The program’s output should match the following:

Enter a single character: a
You entered 'a', which has ASCII code 97.

int main()
{
    char a{};
    std::cout << "enter a single char: ";
    std::cin >> a;

    std::cout << "orig character: " << a << '\n';
    std::cout << "ASCII: " << static_cast<int>(a) << '\n';
}

Question #2

Modify the program you wrote for quiz #1 to use implicit type conversion instead of static_cast. How many different ways can you think of to do this?

Note: You should favor explicit conversions over implicit conversions, so don’t actually do this in real programs -- this is just to test your understanding of where implicit conversions can occur.

int main()
{
    char a{};
    std::cout << "enter a single char: ";
    std::cin >> a;

    std::cout << "orig character: " << a << '\n';
    int x {a};
    std::cout << "ASCII: " << x << '\n';
}


or 


int returnChar(char x)
{
    return x;
}

int main()
{
    char a{};
    std::cout << "enter a single char: ";
    std::cin >> a;

    std::cout << "orig character: " << a << '\n';
    std::cout << "ASCII: " << returnChar(a) << '\n';
}
