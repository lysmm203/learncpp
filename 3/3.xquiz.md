Question #1

The following program is supposed to add two numbers, but doesn’t work correctly.

Use the integrated debugger to step through this program and watch the value of x. Based on the information you learn, fix the following program:

#include <iostream>

int readNumber()
{
    int x{};
    std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> x;
    return x;
}

void writeAnswer(int x)
{
    std::cout << "The sum is: " << x << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    int x {readNumber()};
    x = x + readNumber();
    writeAnswer(x);

    return 0;
}

Question #2

The following program is supposed to divide two numbers, but doesn’t work correctly.

Use the integrated debugger to step through this program. For inputs, enter 8 and 4. Based on the information you learn, fix the following program:

#include <iostream>

int readNumber()
{
    std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;
    return x;
}

void writeAnswer(int x)
{
    std::cout << "The quotient is: " << x << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    int x{readNumber() };
    int y{readNumber() };
    writeAnswer(x/y);

    return 0;
}

Question #3

What does the call stack look like in the following program when the point of execution is on line 4? Only the function names are needed for this exercise, not the line numbers indicating the point of return.

#include <iostream>

void d()
{ // here
}

void c()
{
}

void b()
{
	c();
	d();
}

void a()
{
	b();
}

int main()
{
	a();

	return 0;
}


d
b
a
main
